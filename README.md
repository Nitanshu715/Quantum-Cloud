## 💡 Abstract: Quantum-Enhanced Cloud Resource Optimization

Cloud providers like **AWS** face growing challenges in efficiently allocating compute, storage, and networking resources to diverse workloads. These tasks are **NP-hard optimization problems**, where classical algorithms struggle at scale, leading to inefficiency, higher costs, and increased energy consumption.

Our proposed solution — **Quantum-Cloud Resource Scheduler (QCRS)** — leverages **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** within a **hybrid quantum-classical framework** to enhance resource allocation:

- **Problem Formulation:** Encode workloads, constraints, and costs into a Hamiltonian representation.  
- **Quantum Layer:** Use QAOA on simulators or hardware via **IBM Qiskit** or **AWS Braket**.  
- **Hybrid Workflow:** Classical solvers + AWS autoscaling handle baseline scheduling, while quantum refines hard optimization cases.  
- **Integration:** Connects with **Amazon EKS** / **AWS Batch** for orchestration and resource scaling.  

### 🌍 Impact
- **For Providers:** Improved utilization, cost savings, reduced energy footprint.  
- **For Users:** Faster job execution, lower bills, reliable services.  
- **For Research:** Demonstrates **practical quantum-classical integration** in real-world cloud infrastructure.  

### ✨ Novelty
While quantum optimization has been studied in finance and logistics, applying it directly to **cloud resource scheduling** is a **fresh and impactful frontier**. Starting with simulated workloads (AWS datasets, real job logs), QCRS can evolve towards live deployment in orchestrators like Kubernetes.
